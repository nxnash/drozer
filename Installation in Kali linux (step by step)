This is how I successfully installed drozer on Kali 2020.2 (Linux 5.6.0-kali2-amd64 x86_64) from a wheel.

Please run the following in this exact order:

wget https://github.com/FSecureLABS/drozer/releases/download/2.4.4/drozer-2.4.4-py2-none-any.whl
apt-get --assume-yes install python-pip
pip2 install wheel
pip2 install pyyaml
pip2 install pyhamcrest
pip2 install protobuf 
pip2 install pyopenssl 
pip2 install twisted
pip2 install service_identity
pip2 install drozer-2.4.4-py2-none-any.whl
The key is to use pip2 with Python 2.7.0.

Next, download drozer agent from https://labs.f-secure.com/tools/drozer/.

Install the agent on your mobile device and turn the agent on.

Then, connect your mobile device to your Kali machine and run:

apt-get --assume-yes install adb
adb start-server
adb forward tcp:31415 tcp:31415
drozer console connect
You should see no errors now.

Please share the solution with others if it helps.

If for some strange reason you need java or javac run the following:

apt-get install --assume-yes openjdk-8-jdk-headless
